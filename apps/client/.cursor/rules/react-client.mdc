# React Client Development Guidelines

## TanStack Router Setup

- Use file-based routing in [apps/client/src/routes/](mdc:apps/client/src/routes/)
- Route files should export a `Route` object using `createFileRoute`
- Layout routes use `~_layout.tsx` naming convention
- Root route is [apps/client/src/routes/~\_\_root.tsx](mdc:apps/client/src/routes/~__root.tsx)

## Component Patterns

- Use arrow function syntax for components (as per existing rule)
- Import shadcn components from [apps/client/src/shadcn/components/](mdc:apps/client/src/shadcn/components/)
- Use the `cn` utility from [apps/client/src/shadcn/lib/utils.ts](mdc:apps/client/src/shadcn/lib/utils.ts) for conditional classes
- Follow the existing sidebar layout pattern from [apps/client/src/routes/~app/~\_layout.tsx](mdc:apps/client/src/routes/~app/~_layout.tsx)

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Combine classes with `cn()` utility: `cn("base-class", conditional && "conditional-class")`
- Use `overflow-y-auto` for scrollable content areas
- Follow the existing responsive design patterns

## File Organization

- Routes go in `src/routes/`
- Components go in `src/shadcn/components/` (for shadcn) or create new component directories
- Utilities go in `src/shadcn/lib/`
- Hooks go in `src/shadcn/hooks/`
